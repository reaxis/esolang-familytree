# Esoteric programming languages family tree

![](https://raw.github.com/reaxis/esolang-familytree/master/esolangs.png)

Which languages are based on what other languages?

Based on data from [esolangs.org](http://esolangs.org). Only languages that seem to be inspired by, or inspired other languages are included.

I'm working down [the list](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list) alphabetically. So far, I've managed to do non-alphabetic, A and B.

Also, this is basically me figuring out Dot and Graphviz and such.
